**English 130: Writing About Literature in English**
**Countercultural Revolutions**
**Course Website:** [http://ccrevolutions2017.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu](http://ccrevolutions2017.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu)

In this course, you&#39;ll build on the interdisciplinary work you did in English 110 by learning to write well in the discipline of English—but I think of that goal in loftier terms. My aim is to teach you to write about cultural texts with greater purpose, grace, and integrity. Using the methods of writing and research that literary critics have devised, you&#39;ll identify the questions that interest you most about the texts you read. You&#39;ll pursue answers to those questions as you learn how to contribute meaningfully to a scholarly conversation that precedes you.

This semester we&#39;ll focus our inquiry on texts that have expressed - and emerged out of - radical opposition to values, ideas and sentiments of the dominant culture. Many countercultures – such as the Beats, Hippies, Chicanos, Punks, and Pan-Africanists - were motivated to challenge a system, correct the wrongs, reveal the hypocrisies and bring freedom and equality to the planet, while others fought against anguish, injustice and intolerance. Though these creative minds critiqued society in vastly different ways – in terms of both content and form - they shared a stance of urgent desire for social change. The primary readings draw from a wide range of genres, among which novels, poetry, theatrical plays, fanzines, autobiography, essays and forces in popular culture such as film, comics, and music. We&#39;ll pay special attention to countercultural representations of identity and the way both high and low culture reacted – most often with dissent - to the political climate of the United States at different times throughout the second half of the twentieth century.

**Note:** We will read and, occasionally, view sensitive material. If you object to or areuncomfortable with depictions of sex, drugs, violence, profanities, and so on, you should drop the course. Your continued enrollment in this section indicates your comfort with and responsibility for reading and viewing these texts. Alternate assignments will not be given.

**COURSE GOALS**

Students who elect to take College Writing 2 in the English Department will learn how to engage with other scholars in meaningful conversations about literature. Building methods that they will continue to practice throughout their coursework, they will become more able to:

- Create arguable theses about literary texts.
- Support their theses with close reading.
- Marshal primary and secondary sources for textual analysis.
- Find, cite, and evaluate sources using appropriate research tools.
- Deploy critical terms effectively.
- Converse with other scholars in the field, orally and in writing.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

A methods course in the discipline. Students learn how to engage in scholarly conversations about literature: by using close reading of primary and secondary sources; conducting original research; and developing analytical arguments about literary texts in different genres.

**ASSIGNMENTS &amp; GRADES**

You have three major assignments this semester plus a portfolio that includes them all, but you should note that each of those assignments is broken into a series of much smaller assignments.  That structure ensures that the consistency of your work is crucial to your success in this class.

Your grade for each of the major assignments depends on your completion of the informal assignments they contain, including in-­‐class writing; annotation assignments; and blog posts.   With that in mind, I will assess your grade in the end by this formula:

| Essay 1: Essay 2: Essay 3: Informal Assignments:Portfolio: Participation: | 15%20%30%20%5%10% |
| --- | --- |

When I grade the formal assignments, I will assess them by the strength of your thesis and the degree to which you support your thesis convincingly with solid evidence and analysis.  When I grade the informal assignments, I will assess them entirely by the quality of your engagement—as demonstrated in your creativity, curiosity, and willingness to try.

You may revise your major papers, after they have beengraded, for a higher grade. Details and specific instructions will be provided in class. Plagiarized papers cannot be revised. Informal assignments cannot be revised.

**The Formal Assignments**

**Essay 1: Close reading of a single text (4-­‐5 pp.)** Identify an interpretive problem in Ginsberg&#39;s &quot;Howl&quot; and develop a thesis that addresses it.  Use at least one of the literary terms you&#39;ve learned as a keyterm to analyze the text and support your thesis with close reading.

**Essay 2: Close reading of a single text in context (5-­‐6 pp.)** Use close reading of _A Raisin in the Sun_ to analyze its representation of the American Dream, and historicize your argument using a secondary source.

**Essay 3: Close reading of a primary text in context, with original research (8-­‐10 pp.)**  Make an argument that answers an interpretive question that you raise about _Double Duce_. Support your argument with close reading, using secondary texts to define your terms precisely. You might begin with the historical and theoretical texts that we studied in class and you should also refer to at least two sources that you find through original research.

**Annotated Bibliography Assignment:**  As you revise your essay, annotate the bibliography that you created at our library session, indicating how your sources helped you and adding any new sources that you find.   (At least 8 sources; at least 5 pp.)

**Portfolio Assignment:** Reread all of your pre-drafts, drafts, and revisions as well as the feedback you received.  Put all of these documents in a folder and write a cover letter to present them.  In the letter, reflect on the ways that you&#39;ve developed your critical faculties and practices this semester, and also on the ways that you&#39;d like to continue that development in your future.

**Academic Integrity:** One of the aims of this course is to teach you how to use sources to advance your argument—which means that your research should neither overwhelm your argument nor merely decorate it.
